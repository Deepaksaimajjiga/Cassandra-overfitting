# The PS and the Solution

we have to predict the delivery time of the packages in days which depends upon speed,traffic,navigation e.t.c.
we have created the custom columns to increase accuracy like estimated time.
and we also removed the columns which are correlated.
and finally we applied CatBoost model to train the dataset.
